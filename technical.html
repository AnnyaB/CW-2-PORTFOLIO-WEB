    <!-- Technical Interest Sections -->
    <section id="vedic-cosmology">
        <h2>Vedic Cosmology</h2>
        <img src="VEDIC-COSMOLOGY.jpg" alt="Image representing Vedic Cosmology (Sanksrit label)" loading="lazy">
        <p>I am inspired by Vedic Cosmology through the Srimad Bhagavatam, originally written by Vyasa Dev and translated into English by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. For 1 year and 8 months, I have been exploring its profound insights into the true cosmological order, which harmoniously blend ancient wisdom with scientific understanding.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="cosmic-motions">
        <h2>Cosmic Motions</h2>
        <img src="COSMIC-MOTIONS.jpg" alt="Image representing Cosmic Motions" loading="lazy">
        <p>I am passionate about understanding the forces and movements that govern the universe. Learning more about cosmic motions allows me to contribute to the field of space science and gain insights that can be leveraged in astrophysics research.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="ideas-to-facts">
        <h2>Building Ideas into Facts</h2>
        <img src="IDEAS-TO-REALITY.jpg" alt="Image representing turning ideas into facts" loading="lazy">
        <p>Bringing conceptual ideas to life and validating them with data is fascinating to me. This involves rigorous experimentation, analysis, and continuous learning to transform theoretical concepts into practical solutions.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="game-development">
        <h2>Developing Skill Boosting Games</h2>
        <img src="GAME-DEVELOPMENT.jpg" alt="Image representing Game Development" loading="lazy">
        <p>Developing interactive and engaging games has always been a creative outlet for me. I love the combination of art, storytelling, and technical programming that game development entails, especially in designing immersive user experiences.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="swarm-intelligence">
    <h2>Swarm Intelligence</h2>
    <img src="SWARM-INTELLIGENCE.jpg" alt="Image representing Swarm Intelligence" loading="lazy">
    <p>
        Swarm Intelligence refers to the collective behavior of decentralized, self-organized systems. Think of it like how a group of birds or ants work together to achieve complex tasks, without any one individual being in charge. In technology, this concept is applied to make robots or drones work together as a team, especially in tasks like space exploration or environmental monitoring.
    </p>
    <p>
        I see swarm intelligence as the key to unlocking the potential of coordinated robot and drone fleets in space. These systems can work together to explore, analyze, and uncover the universe's deepest secrets, just like a well-coordinated team working toward a common goal.

    <section id="ai-in-fashion">
        <h2>Artificial Intelligence in Fashion</h2>
        <img src="AI-IN-FASHION.jpg" alt="Image representing Artificial Intelligence in Fashion" loading="lazy">
        <p>Exploring how artificial intelligence can transform the fashion industry is an exciting frontier. I am intrigued by the possibilities Artificial Intelligence offers in personalization, trend forecasting, and sustainable practices in the fashion world.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="robotics-automation">
        <h2>Robotics and Automation</h2>
        <img src="ROBOTICS-AUTOMATION.jpg" alt="Image representing Robotics and Automation" loading="lazy">
        <p>I envision a future where advanced robotics plays a pivotal role in cosmology, enabling us to explore distant planets, analyze cosmic phenomena, and gather data from unreachable areas. By merging robotics with space science, we can push the boundaries of our understanding, making groundbreaking discoveries that could refine our place in the universe.</p>
