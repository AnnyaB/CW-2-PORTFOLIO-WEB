    <section id="vedic-cosmology">
        <h2>Vedic Cosmology</h2>
        <img src="VEDIC-COSMOLOGY.jpg" alt="Image representing Vedic Cosmology">
        <p>I am inspired by Vedic Cosmology through the Srimad Bhagavatam, written by Vyasa Dev and translated by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. It reveals the true cosmological order, offering profound insights into the universe's structure, consciousness, and spiritual dimensions, blending science with ancient wisdom.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="cosmic-motions">
        <h2>Cosmic Motions</h2>
        <img src="COSMIC-MOTIONS.jpg" alt="Image representing Cosmic Motions">
        <p>I am passionate about understanding the forces and movements that govern the universe. Learning more about cosmic motions allows me to contribute to the field of space science and gain insights that can be leveraged in astrophysics research.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="ideas-to-facts">
        <h2>Building Ideas into Facts</h2>
        <img src="IDEAS-TO-REALITY.jpg" alt="Image representing turning ideas into facts">
        <p>Bringing conceptual ideas to life and validating them with data is fascinating to me. This involves rigorous experimentation, analysis, and continuous learning to transform theoretical concepts into practical solutions.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="game-development">
        <h2>Developing Skill Boosting Games</h2>
        <img src="GAME-DEVELOPMENT.jpg" alt="Image representing Game Development">
        <p>Developing interactive and engaging games has always been a creative outlet for me. I love the combination of art, storytelling, and technical programming that game development entails, especially in designing immersive user experiences.</p>
